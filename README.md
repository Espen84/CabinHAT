## User Stories
+ 1 In order to know whether I need to adjust the heating, as a cabin owner I want a solution that helps me make a decision. 

+ 2 As a cabin owner, I would like to see the humidity inside the cabin, so that I can perform maintenance when it is needed, and adjust ventilation.

+ 3 As a cabin owner, I want a web based solution where I can view data about my cabin, evaluate if maintenance is needed, as long as I have network connection.

+ 4 As a cabin owner, I want to see a picture of the weather-conditions outside my cabin to see if I need to go there to check up on things, or shovel snow.

+ 5 As a cabin owner, I want to be able to add several sensor units, in order to have overview of more rooms.

+ 6 As a cabin owner, I would like to see the weather data for the previous week, in order to get an impression of the general status of my cabin for this period.
