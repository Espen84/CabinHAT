# Contribution guide to CabinHAT

## Introduction
Welcome to the CabinHAT project. We gladly accept contributions of any kind. Please read and follow the instructions below to ensure that your contributions adhere to our project.


### About our guidelines
Following the guidelines below helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers of CabinHAT. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What we look for in contributions
CabinHAT is an open source project and we would love to receive contributions from the open source community. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into CabinHAT itself. We want to emphasize that if you want to add functionality etc. then please create an issue for the developers to determine whether this is a desired function. 

## Ground Rules
* Ensure Raspbian compatibility for every change that's accepted. 
* Ensure that code that goes into core meets [all requirements](.../blob/master/SYSARCH-CODE-REQUIREMENTS)
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. The same principle goes for added functions. 
* Discuss things transparently and get community or developer feedback.
* If your contribution does not require a class of its own, please add the code into existing classes.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
* Please be polite to the community and remember that everyone makes mistakes. 

### Your First Contribution
If this is the first time you are contributing to an open source project, these links might be helpful to you: 

http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

If a maintainer or developer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

## Getting started

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in CabinHAT, you might not be alone. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. 

**For something that is bigger than a one- or two-line fix:**

* Create your own fork of the code
* Do the changes in your fork
* If you like the change and think the project could use it: *Be sure you have followed the code style for the project as seen [here](.../blob/master/SYSARCH-CODE-REQUIREMENTS)* 

**For small changes or fixes**

Seeing as the CabinHAT project is small, we handle small changes and corrections by the same process as big ones. However, the smaller the change, the faster it will be implemented. As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. If the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo corrections, white space and formatting changes
* Clean up of comments
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another


### How to report a security vulnerability
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email *vegaal17@student.uia.no* instead.
Any security issues should be submitted directly to vegaal17@student.uia.no in order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
Can I disable something for other people?
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at vegaal17@student.uia.no.

### How to file a bug report
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What version of Python are you using?
1. What version of Flask are you using?
1. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
1. What did you do?
1. What did you expect to see?
1. What did you see instead? 


### Code review process
The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After someone has looked at it, we expect to give responses within one week. Following feedback from us, we expect a response within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

### Community
We are considering setting up community channels, if this is something that you would like to participate in – please contact via email at ingvef17@uia.no. Possible channels might include Discord, IRC or Facebook etc.
